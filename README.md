# Interactive heightmap generator

Project during my masters study, which provides an interactive heightmap generator. With this generator heightmaps can be created and also terrains based on the heightmaps. 
You will find options to specifically add mountains to your heightmap. As well as regions for your terrain which can then get colors set to represent a meadow or sea etc.

## Usage

Drag the `MapGenerator.prefab` from IHMGenv2 into the Scene. In the inspector you will find options to manipulate the heightmap. Then you can generate a terrain based on the heightmap.
